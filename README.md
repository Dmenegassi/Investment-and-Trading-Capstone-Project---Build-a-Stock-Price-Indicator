# Investment-and-Trading-Capstone-Project---Build-a-Stock-Price-Indicator
Udacity Final Project

## Problem Statement
The financial markets sometimes seem to be something terrifying and other times seem to be a golden pot for investors and traders depending on the psychology of the market or in other words, depending on the market sentiment (risk taker or risk averse). But to become a little less reactive and more objective is very important to evaluate the market movements about some statistics and in a more sophisticated approach create models to try to predict those movements. So my purpose here is to calculate some statistics and compare some stocks over these metrics. I will present  some Technical Analysis indicators and see how the stocks behave on them. At the final step I will create some models to predict stock prices and evaluate them.

## Motivation
My motivation for this project was to implement statistics studies applied to the stock markets and present the first steps to become more objective in how to evaluate assets in terms of return, risk, risk adjusted return, interdependency of asset's returns, systematic risk(beta) and so on.

## Project Overview
This project had as a goal implemented a model capable of predicting stock prices, by taking past data as closing prices and some features based on technical analysis indicators. The data was gathered from Yahoo Finance and the needed data preprocessing was made to remove unnecessary features and drop nan values. Until the accomplishment of the proposed task an exploratory analysis had been made with some data visualizations to better understand
